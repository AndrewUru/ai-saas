# Launching Your First Widget

Use this checklist when you want to ship quickly without missing the basics.

## What you need

- A live agent API key
- The domain(s) where the widget will be embedded
- A short greeting and brand label

## Checklist

1. Add your domain to **Allowed domains**.
2. Copy the install snippet and place it before `</body>`.
3. Test the preview with a greeting and brand name.
4. Switch the agent to **Active** and validate the widget loads.

## Example snippet

```html
<script async src="https://yourdomain.com/api/widget?key=agt_xxx"></script>
```

## Common pitfalls

- Missing domain allowance.
- Blocking CSP rules that prevent the script from loading.
- Invalid API key (copy it from the agent detail page).
