# Advanced Human Handoff

Use this guide to design escalation logic that feels seamless for customers.

## Signals to watch

- "Talk to a human" or "call me"
- Pricing or procurement questions
- Repeated requests after failed answers

## Suggested workflow

1. Add a **human support** message that sets expectations.
2. Use a fallback URL to open a booking page.
3. Tag conversations that require follow-up.
